      <description>When two people do not speak the same language, it is impossible for the people to understand each other. This can lead to lots of frustration. Luckily, when a translator is present, the problem goes away and communication is easy. Now what if i told you that this hypothetical language barrier was between two coding languages? That’s right, I’m talking about mortal enemies R and Python. But now, thanks to the translator that is the reticulate package, you can code in both R and python in the same script!</description>
